# taking photos(hhmmss-hhmmss, yyyymmdd-yyyymmdd)

*taking photos (hhmmss-hhmmss, yyyymmdd-yyyymmdd)* is a project that uses time data from smartphone photos to address individuals' biological rhythms, history and memories.

This page is open as an online workshop, supporting you to use your records to create your own work (24 images & 24-hour video).

## Rules for organising photo data
- Prepare the photos stored on your smartphone on your computer; preferably taken over a period of at least one year.
- Delete the following photos;
  - Screenshots / downloaded images
  - Photos taken by anyone other than yourself
  - Edited photos
  - Photos taken for a specific purpose (e.g. wifi passwords, conference/lecture recordings, public relations, etc.)
  - Photos of exhibits (e.g. paintings, texts, photographs, sculptures, posters, etc.)
- Do NOT delete the photos that;
  - are boring
  - you do not remember
  - you took unintentionally
  - you do not want anyone to see
  - you took too many because you were so excited
- For your reference, I had 8,282 photos after sorting from April 2014 to August 2022. 24 hours is 86,400 seconds, so this is not so many.
- Arrange organised photo data in seconds of the day to create 24 images and a 24-hour video.

The 24 images and 24-hour video can be generated by this programme.


## How to run the programme
1. Put all organised image files in "for_sorting" folder.  
*Only jpg is accepted at the moment.  
*This code changes the image names. So please duplicate the files if necessary! 
2. Run "exif_rename.py".  
3. To create 24 images, run "24h_images.py"
4. To create a 24h-video, run "24h_video.py"
5. Running 24h_video_realtime.py shows a window where the images are displayed according to the current time on your computer.
